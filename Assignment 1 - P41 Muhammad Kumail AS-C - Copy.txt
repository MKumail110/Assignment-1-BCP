Q4- Find the character that appears most number of times in an entered string and output it.

----Pseudocode----

Declare string1 as string 
Declare i as integer 
Declare char as char
Declare y as integer
Declare char2 as char 
Declare charcount as integer
Declare maxcharvalue as integer
Declare maxchar as char

string1 ← ""
i ← 0
char ← ''
y ← 0
char2 ← ''
charcount ← 0
maxcharvalue ← 0
maxchar ← ''

input "Enter String: ", string1

For i ← 1 to len(string1)
	char ← MID (string1 ,i, 1)
	
	For y ← 1 to len(string1) 
		char2 ← MID (string1 ,y, 1) 
		if char = char2 then 
			charcount ← charcount + 1
		endif  
		if charcount > maxcharvalue then 
			maxcharvalue ← charcount 
			maxchar ← char
		endif
	Next y
	charcount ← 0	
Next i	

output ("The most repeated character is ", maxchar)
output ("Additional times repeated: ", maxcharvalue)
